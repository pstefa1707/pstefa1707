Hi, I'm Paras . I'm studying computer science at the Australian National University and working as a software developer at [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/en/).

I am open to casual software related employment and internships.

I enjoy working with people, throwing myself in the deep-end and learning new things.

I have co-founded ([Lambda Consulting](https://lambdaconsulting.com.au)) with the goal of broadening my experience working with a variety of technologies.
