Hi, I'm Paras. I'm studying computer science at the Australian National University and run a small-scale [software consultancy](https://lambdaconsulting.com.au/).

I love theoretical computer science and have a keen interest in software design and engineering.

When I'm not tip-tapping away on my newest project I enjoy playing soccer, hanging out with friends and maintaining my fitness!
