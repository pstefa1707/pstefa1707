Hi, I'm Paras . I'm studying computer science at the Australian National University and working as a software developer at [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/en/).

I love theoretical computer science and have a keen interest in software design and engineering.

When I'm not tip-tapping away on my newest project I enjoy playing soccer, hanging out with friends and maintaining my fitness!
